## Introduction
The National Basketball Association otherwise known as the NBA is a men's professional basketball league founded 71 years ago in 1946. There are currently 29 American and 1 Canadian teams totaling 491 players on the opening day for the 2017-2018 season. The NBA has the world's highest paid players by average per player and obtains a high amount of viewership with 58 million people tuning in annually. 

For our final project, we are interested in assessing the following three areas:

### Part I: Analysis of Salaries relationship with NBA statistics

First, our team is going to determine whether there are any statistical categories that are correlated with the salary of a player within the NBA. As of today, the categories most associated the quality of a player is their points-per-game, number of assists, and total rebounds per game, and effective field goal percentage. Therefore, we are going to explore the relationship these fields have on a players salary and determine whether correlated with a player's salary. 

Second, our team will develop a model that can accurately predicts a player's salary based on their performance statistics. From there we will determine which players are the most over, fairly, and under paid. 
  
Lastly, we will compare our model to other aggregate statistical models such as the PER and VORP estimates commonly used my statisticians withing the league. 

    Questions:
    1. Which if any statistical Categories are the most correlated with the salary of a player within the NBA?
    
    2. Can we develop a model that can accurately predict a player's salary based on their performance statistics?
    
    3. According to the above model, which players are the most the most over and under paid?
    
    4. How does our model match up with other aggregrate statistical models (such as PER and VORP)?


### Part II: 3-Point Shooting Analysis
The 3-point field goal is one that is made beyond the 3-point line, which is a dedicated arc surrounding the basket. A shot made from the boundary counts as 3-points. During the 1979-1980 season this shot was adopted by the NBA. Since the inception of the 3-point shot in the NBA and it's initial perception as a "gimmick" shot, it has become more popular. Our team would like to determine whether this is true, and if so, explore how it has changed over the years. 

Since attempting the 3-point field goal holds a greater risk but awarding teams with a greater number of goals we are going to test the above analysis adjusted for the pace of play during the game. By doing so, we'll effectively assess the true evolution of the 3-point shot over the years since it was introduced. 

Another interest of ours is to explore whether any teams in particular have become more dependent on the 3-point shot, and if so, how has this altered their statistics over time. In other words, we'll explore how the frequency of the 3-point field goal increases or decreases the scoring efficiency of teams as well as their scoring volume. Like before, we'll also adjust this analysis for how the pace of play has changed and assess how it vary's the above associations. 

    Questions:
    1. The 3pt shot has seemingly become more popular in the last couple decades.  Is this true? Does this still hold true when adjusting for pace of play?
    
    2. Have any teams in particular had more increases?
    
    3. If so, has the amount of 3pt shots increased the scoring efficiency and/or scoring volume?  Does this still hold true when adjusting for pace of play?

### Part III: Simple Draft Analysis 
Lastly, we are curious which universities produce the highest number players and lottery players within the NBA draft. It is worth noting that a lottery player is one that is drafted within the first 14-picks by NBA teams. These are widely considered the best players in college basketball (NCAA) and are typically the top performing players in the professional league. 

Solely relying on visualization for these analysis will be sufficient and should paint a good picture for which universities are the NBA player producing powerhouses.

    Questions:
    1. Which universities produce the greatest number of NBA players?
    
    2. Which universities produce the greatest number of lotter picks (top-14) in the NBA draft?
